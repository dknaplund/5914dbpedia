## Okay... So what is SPARQL?

(Hao and Brian) This is where we talk about SPARQL and how to use that, with sample queries set up like this (I (Dylan) wrote this one feel free to use it
```markdown
PREFIX dbpedia2: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>
PREFIX albums: <http://dbpedia.org/resource/Category:Green_Day_albums>
SELECT ?term ?title WHERE {
    ?term ?property albums: .
    ?term dbpedia2:title ?title .
    ?title dbo:musicalArtist :Green_Day
} ORDER BY ?term
```

## Okay then... How do I put it into my project?

(Dylan and Peiyuan) This is where we talk about how to integrate DBpedia into a project. I found the thing on a Python package to make SPARQL queries with, I'll add it later.
